# hashblot

Expressive hash visualization - http://hashblot.com

## What it is

Hashblot, at its most general level, is an algorithm for visualizing hash functions, by interpreting a sequence of bytes as a series of curves.

This repository contains a JavaScript library for converting byte sequences to paths, and an HTML file that takes that output for the SHA-1 hash of a string and displays the resulting image. See the "Methods" section for the exact functionality it provides.

## Installation

For Node.js/browserify:

    npm install --save hashblot

For Bower:

    bower install hashblot

hashblot.js will assign to `exports.module` if present, and `window.hashblot` if not, allowing it to be required as a Node/browserify module or included as a `<script>` source.

## Methods

### hashblot.pd.q

Takes an array of coordinates with a length divisible by 4 and converts it to an SVG Path Description string, like so:

1. Prefix the entire string with 'M' + the last two numbers, denoting that the 'pen' should be moved to the last position in the shape before drawing the curves, so it will finish as a closed path where it started.
2. Append "Q", followed by all the passed-in coordinates separated by commas, to denote a series of absolute-positioned quadratic BÃ©zier curves, with each even pair of numbers as the X and Y coordinates of the control point, and each odd pair of numbers as the X and Y coordinates of the end point.

This function is meant to be used with an array of bytes returned from a hash function. For scenarios where you only have a hexadecimal string, you can use `hashblot.hexBytes` to convert a hexadecimal string to an array of bytes.

### hashblot.path2d.q

Takes an array of coordinates with a length divisible by 4 and an optional object implementing the [CanvasPathMethods][] `moveTo` and `quadraticCurveTo`.

[CanvasPathMethods]: http://html5index.org/Canvas%20-%20CanvasPathMethods.html

This function applies `moveTo` and `quadraticCurveTo` operations for the given hash (as described in `hashblot.pd.q`) to the given object. If no object is given, this function will create a `new Path2D()` and return that.

### hashblot.sha1qpd, hashblot.sha1qpath2d

These are versions of `hashblot.pd.q` and `hashblot.path2d.q` (respectively) that take a string, which is then converted to its SHA-1 hash and used with the corresponding function.

When `module` is defined, this function will require and use the `crypto` module to produce the SHA-1 hash.

Otherwise, it will use whatever "sha1" function is bound (see `hashblot.sha1` below).

### hashblot.bindSha1

The SHA-1 function for `hashblot.sha1qpd` and `hashblot.sha1qpath2d` is bound to whatever value of `hashblot.sha1` is defined when one of these functions is first called.

It can be bound sooner by calling `hashblot.bindSha1`, with an optional argument containing the SHA-1 function to use.

In browser environments where there are multiple potential SHA-1 implementations available, you can use [any_sha1][] to automatically define the appropriate function to use:

```
hashblot.bindSha1(any_sha1.from(any_sha1.utf8.bytes));
```

You can also copy the appropriate function for your specific library (as this module's index.html does, for [Rusha][]).

## Usage

See index.html for an example of using hashblot.js to generate an image.
